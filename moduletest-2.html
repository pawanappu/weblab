		<p>The first and probably most noticeable difference is the group of heroes that make up the Avengers. In the movie the group consists of Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Black Widow were all assembled at the same time. In the original comic book series, the group includes Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Ant Man, Wasp, and in a few issues later, Captain America and Hawkeye were added to the team as well. Also in the comics, as time goes on the group loses and gains a variety of members, including the Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, Beast, Wonder Man, Falcon, Ms. Marvel, Wolverine, She-Hulk, Storm, Spider-Man, Luke Cage, and a many more who were not pictured in the film.</p>
